    <h3>What is code day?</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Code Day</b> is a global event that brings together students,
      professionals, and tech enthusiasts for a day of learning, collaboration,
      and creativity in coding. Typically, participants from various backgrounds
      work on coding projects, from building websites and apps to developing
      games and creating artistic visualizations using code. It's a hands-on
      experience where people can learn new programming skills, explore
      different technologies, and collaborate with others to solve real-world
      problems. Code Day often includes workshops, mentorship opportunities, and
      challenges that encourage innovation and creativity. The event is designed
      to be inclusive, welcoming individuals with all levels of coding
      experience, from beginners to advanced developers. It’s a fantastic
      opportunity for people to network, share ideas, and gain practical
      experience in a fun, supportive environment. The spirit of
      <b>CodeDay</b> revolves around learning through doing, fostering a
      community of curious minds who are eager to explore the limitless
      possibilities of technology.

    <h3>How was my experience</h3>
    <p>
      I had an incredible time at Code Day! The energy was fantastic, and the
      workshops were super engaging. The Generative AI session, in particular,
      blew my mind. We explored how AI can be used to create art, which was both
      fascinating and inspiring. I learned a lot of new concepts, from how AI
      models are trained to the creative possibilities they offer. It wasn’t
      just about coding; it was about pushing boundaries and experimenting with
      new ideas. The hands-on activities allowed me to dive deep into the
      technology, and I left with a newfound excitement for AI. Another
      highlight was the chat with Walden Yan. It was insightful and motivating
      to hear from someone who’s making such an impact in the field. He shared
      valuable advice on navigating the tech world and creating innovative
      projects, which really stuck with me. Overall, Code Day was a blast, and I
      can’t wait for the next one!
